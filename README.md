This program can work with live camera/webcam or a recorded video. You can read the manual to know how to feed a video stream to it or use a live camera. For live camera, it may not be robust. The output is related to quality of the camera and not having blured frames when moving.

To run in your own machine:
You need to compile CUDA for your opencv 2.411 version and then recompile the code in your machine.
There is a manual I wrote: "how to compile the code.pdf" or you can use other helpful links over the internet about compiling opencv for cuda.
I used visual studio but you can use g++ to compile but you need to link the libraries.
